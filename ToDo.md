# To Do:
- [ ] create board
  - [ ] display game grid
  - [ ] display hit squares
  - [ ] display miss squares
  - [ ] (optional) display ship images
Each square will have classes defining what to display:
* hit/miss (empty will display nothing)
* sunk will show the images
* horizontal/vertical will show the orientation of the images
* 'ship-name' will determine the ship to display

Should a table be used for the grid? Probably be easiest, but will it scale?
